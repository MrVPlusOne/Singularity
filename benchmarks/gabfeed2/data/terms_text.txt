lupus= Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body (skin, joints, and/or organs inside the body). Chronic means that the signs and symptoms tend to last longer than six weeks and often for many years.

In lupus, something goes wrong with your immune system, which is the part of the body that fights off viruses, bacteria, and germs ("foreign invaders," like the flu). Normally our immune system produces proteins called antibodies that protect the body from these invaders. Autoimmune means your immune system cannot tell the difference between these foreign invaders and your body’s healthy tissues ("auto" means "self") and creates autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue. These autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body.

epilepsy=Epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects the nervous system. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition.

Seizures seen in epilepsy are caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the brain. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown. 

Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well.

Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome.

The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. 

Having seizures and epilepsy also can also affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. How epilepsy is perceived or how people are treated (stigma) often is a bigger problem than the seizures.
  
The human brain is the source of all human epilepsy.

A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but often the cause is completely unknown. The word "epilepsy" does not indicate anything about the cause of the person's seizures or their severity.

What Happens During a Seizure?

    The electrical activity is caused by complex chemical changes that occur in nerve cells.
    Brain cells either excite or inhibit (stop) other brain cells from sending messages. Usually there is a balance of cells that excite and those that can stop these messages. However, when a seizure occurs, there may be too much or too little activity, causing an imbalance between exciting and stopping activity. The chemical changes can lead to surges of electrical activity that cause seizures.
    Seizures are not a disease in themselves. Instead, they are a symptom of many different disorders that can affect the brain. Some seizures can hardly be noticed, while others are totally disabling.

The nature of seizures varies, because the lobes of the brain control different behaviors, movements and experiences.

If I have just one or two seizures does that mean I will get epilepsy?

    About half of the people who have one seizure without a clear cause will have another one, usually within 6 months.
    If there is a known cause for your seizure (for example, brain injury or other type of known brain condition), then you are twice as likely to have another seizure.
    If you have two seizures, there's about an 80% chance that you'll have more.
    If your first seizure occurred at the time of an injury or infection in the brain, then you are more likely to develop epilepsy. Often, more seizures don’t occur until weeks or months after the initial injury or infection.
    More seizures are also likely if your doctor finds abnormalities on a neurological examination (tests that are done in a doctor’s office to see how the nervous system is working).
    An EEG test or electroencephalogram (e-LEK-tro_en_SEF-uh_LOG-ram) can look at the electrical activity of the brain and may help predict whether more seizures will occur. Certain patterns on the EEG are typical of epilepsy. If your brain waves show patterns of that type, you are about twice as likely to develop epilepsy.

diabetes=Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia). 

 There are three types of diabetes:
1) Type 1 diabetes
MNT Knowledge Center

The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.

Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 1 diabetes page.
2) Type 2 diabetes

The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).

Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.
Diabetes patient measuring glucose level in bloodMeasuring the glucose level in blood

Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.

Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.

Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. 

For more information on how type 1 and type 2 diabetes compare, see our article: the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 2 diabetes page.
3) Gestational diabetes

This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.

The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.

cancer=Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body’s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.

Many cancers form solid tumors, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not form solid tumors.

Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.

Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. When removed, they usually don’t grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life threatening.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. One important difference is that cancer cells are less specialized than normal cells. That is, whereas normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not. This is one reason that, unlike normal cells, cancer cells continue to divide without stopping.

In addition, cancer cells are able to ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or that begin a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells.

Cancer cells may be able to influence the normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels that surround and feed a tumor—an area known as the microenvironment. For instance, cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, which they need to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste products from tumors.

Cancer cells are also often able to evade the immune system, a network of organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions. Although the immune system normally removes damaged or abnormal cells from the body, some cancer cells are able to “hide” from the immune system.

Tumors can also use the immune system to stay alive and grow. For example, with the help of certain immune system cells that normally prevent a runaway immune response, cancer cells can actually keep the immune system from killing cancer cells.

Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited from our parents. They can also arise during a person’s lifetime as a result of errors that occur as cells divide or because of damage to DNA caused by certain environmental exposures. Cancer-causing environmental exposures include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, and radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Risk Factors page has more information.)

Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.

In general, cancer cells have more genetic changes, such as mutations in DNA, than normal cells. Some of these changes may have nothing to do with the cancer; they may be the result of the cancer, rather than its cause.

HIV=HIV is a virus that gradually attacks the immune system, which is our body's natural defence against illness. If a person becomes infected with HIV, they will find it harder to fight off infections and diseases. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a T-helper cell and makes copies of itself inside them. T-helper cells are also referred to as CD4 cells.

There are many different strains of HIV – someone who is infected may carry various different strains in their body. These are classified into types, with lots of groups and subtypes. The two main types are:

    HIV-1: the most common type found worldwide
    HIV-2: this is found mainly in Western Africa, with some cases in India and Europe.
    
(See http://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids for more info.)


Multiple Sclerosis=Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).

In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged.

Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms.

There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.

(See http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 for more info.)
 
 
malaria=Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2013 an estimated 198 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 500,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 1,500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. 

(See http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ for more info.)


fibromyalgia=Fibromyalgia syndrome affects the muscles and soft tissue. Symptoms include chronic muscle pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and painful tender points or trigger points, which can be relieved through medications, lifestyle changes and stress management.

angina=If you have a feeling of pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign from your heart.

There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.

The chest pain you feel with angina happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's caused when something blocks the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.

Angina usually goes away quickly, but it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have angina. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack in the future.

There are different types of angina:

Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it's a sign that you're more likely to have one in the future. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.

Unstable angina. It happens while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long lasting, and can come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.

Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night during sleep or while at rest. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.

Angina is usually caused by heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces the heart to work with less oxygen, and that causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.

Other less common causes of chest pain include:

    A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
    An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    Narrowing of the valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)
    Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)
    Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)

Symptoms

Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:

    Aching
    Burning
    Discomfort
    Feeling of fullness in the chest
    Heaviness
    Pressure
    Squeezing

You are likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.

It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.

Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.

One study found women were more likely to use the words "pressing" or "crushing" to describe the feeling.

Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not -- and could get worse.

(See http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-angina for more info.)


pericarditis=Pericardial disease, or pericarditis, is inflammation of any of the layers of the pericardium. The pericardium is a thin tissue sac that surrounds the heart and consists of:

    Visceral pericardium -- an inner layer that envelopes the entire heart
    A middle fluid layer to prevent friction between the visceral pericardium and parietal pericardium
    Parietal pericardium -- an outer layer made of fibrous tissue
    
Causes of pericarditis include:

    Infections
    Heart surgery
    Heart attack
    Trauma
    Tumors
    Cancer
    Radiation
    Autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma)

For some people, no cause can be found.

Pericarditis can be acute (occurring suddenly) or chronic (long-standing).
What Are the Symptoms of Pericarditis?

When present, symptoms of pericarditis may include:

    Chest pain. This pain is frequently sharp and located in the center of the chest. The pain may radiate to the neck and shoulders, and occasionally, the arms and back. It can be made worse when lying down, coughing, or swallowing and may be relieved by sitting forward.
    Low-grade fever.
    Increased heart rate.

How Is Pericarditis Diagnosed?

Your doctor can diagnose pericarditis based on:

    Reported symptoms
    Electrocardiagram (EKG or ECG) results
    Physical exam

Other tests may be performed to determine the cause of pericarditis.
What Is the Treatment for Pericarditis?

Treatment of pericarditis is based on the cause and may include:

    Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to decrease the pain and inflammation
    Steroids, used occasionally for severe attacks
    Antibiotics, if the pericarditis is due to infection
    Colchicine, particularly if symptoms last for several weeks or occur on a repetitive basis

Most patients recover from pericarditis in two to four weeks.
    
(See http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-pericardial-disease-percarditis#2 for more info.)

anemia=Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:

    Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.
    Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.
    Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.

There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.

(See http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics for more info.)

ringworm=Ringworm is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches of ringworm on your skin at once.
Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    Beard -- tinea barbae
    Body -- tinea corporis
    Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot)
    Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch)
    Scalp -- tinea capitis

Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails.
Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm include:

    Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.
    The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges.
    Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.

If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.
Exams and Tests

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose ringworm by looking at your skin. The fungus may glow when your skin is examined with a blue light (called a Wood's lamp) in a dark room.

Tests to confirm the diagnosis may include:

    KOH exam
    Skin biopsy
    Skin culture

Treatment

To care for ringworm:

    Keep your skin clean and dry.
    Apply over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders, lotions, or creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, or similar ingredients.
    Do not wear clothing that rubs against and irritates the area.
    Wash sheets and nightclothes every day while you are infected.

Your health care provider may prescribe pills to treat the fungus if you have:

    A severe case of ringworm
    Ringworm that keeps coming back or that lasts for a long time
    Ringworm in your hair

You may need medicines such as ketoconazole, which are stronger than over-the-counter products. You may also need antibiotics to treat skin infections from strep or staph that are caused by scratching the area.

Infected pets also should be treated.

(See https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001439.htm for more info.)

polio=Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Up to 70% of infections cause no symptoms.[1] Another 25% of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a soar throat and up to 5% have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs.[1][2] These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In about 0.5% of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.[1] This can occur over a few hours to few days.[1][2] The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2% to 5% of children and 15% to 30% of adults die.[1] Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.[3]

Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected feces entering the mouth.[1] It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva.[1][2] Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood.[1]

The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, a number of doses are required for it to be effective.[2] The United States Center for Disease Control recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring.[4] Once infected there is no specific treatment.[2] In 2013 polio affected 416 people down from 350,000 cases in 1988.[2] In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.[2] In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus.[5]

Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.[1] The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789[1] and the virus that causes it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner.[6] Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States.[1] In the 20th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas.[7] The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk.[8] It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.[9] In 2013; however, there were reports of new cases in Syria[10] and in May 2014, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[11] The disease does not naturally occur in any other animals.[1]

Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.[1] The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789[1] and the virus that causes it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner.[6] Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States.[1] In the 20th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas.[7] The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk.[8] It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.[9] In 2013; however, there were reports of new cases in Syria[10] and in May 2014, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[11] The disease does not naturally occur in any other animals.[1]

gonorrhea=Also called the "clap" or "drip," gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. Gonorrhea may also be spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, so that a mother could pass on the infection to her newborn during childbirth. Both men and women can get gonorrhea. The infection is easily spread and occurs most often in people who have many sex partners.

Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a bacterium that can grow and multiply easily in mucus membranes of the body. Gonorrhea bacteria can grow in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix (opening to the womb), uterus (womb), and fallopian tubes (egg canals) in women, and in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) in women and men. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat, and anus.

Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease in the U.S. Each year, according to the CDC, there are as many as 700,000 new cases, with less than half of them reported to the CDC. There were 334,826 reported cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2012. Sexually active teenagers have one of the highest rates of reported infections.

Not all people infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, so knowing when to seek treatment can be tricky. When symptoms do occur, they are often within two to 10 days after exposure, but they can take up to 30 days to develop and include the following:

Gonorrhea symptoms in women

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the vagina
    Lower abdominal or pelvic pain
    Burning when urinating
    Conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)
    Bleeding between periods
    Spotting after intercourse
    Swelling of the vulva (vulvitis)
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In some women, symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed.

Many women with gonorrhea discharge think they have a yeast infection and self-treat with over-the-counter yeast infection drug. Because vaginal discharge can be a sign of a number of different problems, it is best to always seek the advice of a doctor to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

Gonorrhea symptoms in men

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the penis
    Burning when urinating
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Painful or swollen testicles
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In men, symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after infection.

(See http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/gonorrhea for more info.)

diarrhea=Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, an increase in the looseness of stool or both.
    Diarrhea is caused by increased secretion of fluid into the intestine, reduced absorption of fluid from the intestine or rapid passage of stool through the intestine.
    Symptoms associated with diarrhea include abdominal pain, especially cramping. Other symptoms depend on the cause of the diarrhea.
    Diarrhea can be defined absolutely or relatively. Absolute diarrhea is defined as more than five bowel movements a day or liquid stools. Relative diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of bowel movements per day or an increase in the looseness of stools compared with an individual's usual bowel habit.
    Diarrhea may be either acute or chronic, and each has different causes and treatments.
    Complications of diarrhea include dehydration, electrolyte (mineral) abnormalities, and irritation of the anus.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of acute diarrhea include examination of stool for white blood cells or enzymes that they produce, parasites, cultures of stool for bacteria, testing of stool for the toxins of C. difficile, and blood tests for electrolyte abnormalities.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea include examination of stool for parasites, upper gastrointestinal X-rays (UGI series), barium enema, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, colonoscopy with biopsies, small intestinal endoscopy, hydrogen breath testing, measurement of fat in the stool, and pancreatic function tests.
    Dehydration can be treated at home with home remedies, oral rehydration solutions.
    Absorbents (that absorb water in the intestine), anti-motility medications, bismuth compounds, and IV fluids if necessary.
    Antibiotics should not be used in treating diarrhea unless there is a culture-proven bacterial infection that requires antibiotics, severe diarrhea that is likely to be infectious in origin, or when an individual has serious underlying diseases.


Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.

Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:

    Incontinence of stool, which is the inability to control (delay) bowel movements until an appropriate time, for example, until one can get to the toilet
    Rectal urgency, which is a sudden urge to have a bowel movement that is so strong that if a toilet is not immediately available there will be incontinence
    Incomplete evacuation, which is a sensation that another bowel movement is necessary soon after a bowel movement, yet there is difficulty passing further stool the second time
    Bowel movements immediately after eating a meal Continue Reading

dyslexia=A good way to understand dyslexia is to establish what it is not. It’s not a sign of low intelligence or laziness. It’s also not due to poor vision. It’s a common condition that affects the way the brain processes written and spoken language.

Dyslexia is primarily associated with trouble reading. Some doctors, specialists and educators may refer to it as a “reading disorder” or a “reading disability.” But it can also affect writing, spelling and even speaking.

People with dyslexia can still understand complex ideas. Sometimes they just need more time to work through the information. They may also need a different way to process the information, such as listening to an audiobook instead of reading it. 

(See https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/dyslexia/understanding-dyslexia for more info.)


epilepsy=Epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects the nervous system. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition.

Seizures seen in epilepsy are caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the brain. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown. 

Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well.

Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome.

The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. 

Having seizures and epilepsy also can also affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. How epilepsy is perceived or how people are treated (stigma) often is a bigger problem than the seizures.
  
The human brain is the source of all human epilepsy.

A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but often the cause is completely unknown. The word "epilepsy" does not indicate anything about the cause of the person's seizures or their severity.

What Happens During a Seizure?

    The electrical activity is caused by complex chemical changes that occur in nerve cells.
    Brain cells either excite or inhibit (stop) other brain cells from sending messages. Usually there is a balance of cells that excite and those that can stop these messages. However, when a seizure occurs, there may be too much or too little activity, causing an imbalance between exciting and stopping activity. The chemical changes can lead to surges of electrical activity that cause seizures.
    Seizures are not a disease in themselves. Instead, they are a symptom of many different disorders that can affect the brain. Some seizures can hardly be noticed, while others are totally disabling.

The nature of seizures varies, because the lobes of the brain control different behaviors, movements and experiences.

If I have just one or two seizures does that mean I will get epilepsy?

    About half of the people who have one seizure without a clear cause will have another one, usually within 6 months.
    If there is a known cause for your seizure (for example, brain injury or other type of known brain condition), then you are twice as likely to have another seizure.
    If you have two seizures, there's about an 80% chance that you'll have more.
    If your first seizure occurred at the time of an injury or infection in the brain, then you are more likely to develop epilepsy. Often, more seizures don\u2019t occur until weeks or months after the initial injury or infection.
    More seizures are also likely if your doctor finds abnormalities on a neurological examination (tests that are done in a doctor\u2019s office to see how the nervous system is working).
    An EEG test or electroencephalogram (e-LEK-tro_en_SEF-uh_LOG-ram) can look at the electrical activity of the brain and may help predict whether more seizures will occur. Certain patterns on the EEG are typical of epilepsy. If your brain waves show patterns of that type, you are about twice as likely to develop epilepsy.

diabetes=Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia). 

 There are three types of diabetes:
1) Type 1 diabetes
MNT Knowledge Center

The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.

Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 1 diabetes page.
2) Type 2 diabetes

The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).

Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.
Diabetes patient measuring glucose level in bloodMeasuring the glucose level in blood

Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.

Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.

Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. 

For more information on how type 1 and type 2 diabetes compare, see our article: the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 2 diabetes page.
3) Gestational diabetes

This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.

The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.

cancer=Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body\u2019s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.

Many cancers form solid tumors, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not form solid tumors.

Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.

Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. When removed, they usually don\u2019t grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life threatening.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. One important difference is that cancer cells are less specialized than normal cells. That is, whereas normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not. This is one reason that, unlike normal cells, cancer cells continue to divide without stopping.

In addition, cancer cells are able to ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or that begin a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells.

Cancer cells may be able to influence the normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels that surround and feed a tumor\u2014an area known as the microenvironment. For instance, cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, which they need to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste products from tumors.

Cancer cells are also often able to evade the immune system, a network of organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions. Although the immune system normally removes damaged or abnormal cells from the body, some cancer cells are able to \u201chide\u201d from the immune system.

Tumors can also use the immune system to stay alive and grow. For example, with the help of certain immune system cells that normally prevent a runaway immune response, cancer cells can actually keep the immune system from killing cancer cells.

Cancer is a genetic disease\u2014that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited from our parents. They can also arise during a person\u2019s lifetime as a result of errors that occur as cells divide or because of damage to DNA caused by certain environmental exposures. Cancer-causing environmental exposures include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, and radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Risk Factors page has more information.)

Each person\u2019s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.

In general, cancer cells have more genetic changes, such as mutations in DNA, than normal cells. Some of these changes may have nothing to do with the cancer; they may be the result of the cancer, rather than its cause.

HIV=HIV is a virus that gradually attacks the immune system, which is our body's natural defence against illness. If a person becomes infected with HIV, they will find it harder to fight off infections and diseases. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a T-helper cell and makes copies of itself inside them. T-helper cells are also referred to as CD4 cells.

There are many different strains of HIV \u2013 someone who is infected may carry various different strains in their body. These are classified into types, with lots of groups and subtypes. The two main types are:

    HIV-1: the most common type found worldwide
    HIV-2: this is found mainly in Western Africa, with some cases in India and Europe.
    
(See http://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids for more info.)


Multiple Sclerosis=Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).

In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged.

Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms.

There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.

(See http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 for more info.)
 
 
malaria=Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2013 an estimated 198 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 500,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 1,500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. 

(See http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ for more info.)


fibromyalgia=Fibromyalgia syndrome affects the muscles and soft tissue. Symptoms include chronic muscle pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and painful tender points or trigger points, which can be relieved through medications, lifestyle changes and stress management. 

Symptoms of fibromyalgia come in many shapes and sizes -- and fibromyalgia is often confused with other conditions. Learn all about fibromyalgia symptoms and how to manage your symptoms effectively.

(See http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/ for more info.)


angina=If you have a feeling of pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign from your heart.

There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.

The chest pain you feel with angina happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's caused when something blocks the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.

Angina usually goes away quickly, but it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have angina. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack in the future.

There are different types of angina:

Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it's a sign that you're more likely to have one in the future. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.

Unstable angina. It happens while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long lasting, and can come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.

Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night during sleep or while at rest. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.

Angina is usually caused by heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces the heart to work with less oxygen, and that causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.

Other less common causes of chest pain include:

    A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
    An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    Narrowing of the valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)
    Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)
    Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)

Symptoms

Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:

    Aching
    Burning
    Discomfort
    Feeling of fullness in the chest
    Heaviness
    Pressure
    Squeezing

You are likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.

It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.

Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.

One study found women were more likely to use the words "pressing" or "crushing" to describe the feeling.

Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not -- and could get worse.

(See http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-angina for more info.)


pericarditis=Pericardial disease, or pericarditis, is inflammation of any of the layers of the pericardium. The pericardium is a thin tissue sac that surrounds the heart and consists of:

    Visceral pericardium -- an inner layer that envelopes the entire heart
    A middle fluid layer to prevent friction between the visceral pericardium and parietal pericardium
    Parietal pericardium -- an outer layer made of fibrous tissue
    
Causes of pericarditis include:

    Infections
    Heart surgery
    Heart attack
    Trauma
    Tumors
    Cancer
    Radiation
    Autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma)

For some people, no cause can be found.

Pericarditis can be acute (occurring suddenly) or chronic (long-standing).
What Are the Symptoms of Pericarditis?

When present, symptoms of pericarditis may include:

    Chest pain. This pain is frequently sharp and located in the center of the chest. The pain may radiate to the neck and shoulders, and occasionally, the arms and back. It can be made worse when lying down, coughing, or swallowing and may be relieved by sitting forward.
    Low-grade fever.
    Increased heart rate.

How Is Pericarditis Diagnosed?

Your doctor can diagnose pericarditis based on:

    Reported symptoms
    Electrocardiagram (EKG or ECG) results
    Physical exam

Other tests may be performed to determine the cause of pericarditis.
What Is the Treatment for Pericarditis?

Treatment of pericarditis is based on the cause and may include:

    Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to decrease the pain and inflammation
    Steroids, used occasionally for severe attacks
    Antibiotics, if the pericarditis is due to infection
    Colchicine, particularly if symptoms last for several weeks or occur on a repetitive basis

Most patients recover from pericarditis in two to four weeks.
    
(See http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-pericardial-disease-percarditis#2 for more info.)

anemia=Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:

    Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.
    Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.
    Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.

There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.

(See http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics for more info.)

ringworm=Ringworm is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches of ringworm on your skin at once.
Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    Beard -- tinea barbae
    Body -- tinea corporis
    Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot)
    Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch)
    Scalp -- tinea capitis

Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails.
Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm include:

    Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.
    The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges.
    Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.

If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.
Exams and Tests

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose ringworm by looking at your skin. The fungus may glow when your skin is examined with a blue light (called a Wood's lamp) in a dark room.

Tests to confirm the diagnosis may include:

    KOH exam
    Skin biopsy
    Skin culture

Treatment

To care for ringworm:

    Keep your skin clean and dry.
    Apply over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders, lotions, or creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, or similar ingredients.
    Do not wear clothing that rubs against and irritates the area.
    Wash sheets and nightclothes every day while you are infected.

Your health care provider may prescribe pills to treat the fungus if you have:

    A severe case of ringworm
    Ringworm that keeps coming back or that lasts for a long time
    Ringworm in your hair

You may need medicines such as ketoconazole, which are stronger than over-the-counter products. You may also need antibiotics to treat skin infections from strep or staph that are caused by scratching the area.

Infected pets also should be treated.

(See https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001439.htm for more info.)

dermatophytosis=Ringworm (dermatophytosis) is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches of ringworm on your skin at once.
Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    Beard -- tinea barbae

Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails.
Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm include:

    Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.
    The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges.
    Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.

If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.
Exams and Tests

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose ringworm by looking at your skin. The fungus may glow when your skin is examined with a blue light (called a Wood's lamp) in a dark room.

Tests to confirm the diagnosis may include:

    KOH exam
    Skin biopsy
    Skin culture

Treatment

To care for ringworm:

    Keep your skin clean and dry.
    Apply over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders, lotions, or creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, or similar ingredients.
    Do not wear clothing that rubs against and irritates the area.
    Wash sheets and nightclothes every day while you are infected.

Your health care provider may prescribe pills to treat the fungus if you have:

    A severe case of ringworm
    Ringworm that keeps coming back or that lasts for a long time
    Ringworm in your hair

You may need medicines such as ketoconazole, which are stronger than over-the-counter products. You may also need antibiotics to treat skin infections from strep or staph that are caused by scratching the area.

Infected pets also should be treated.

polio=Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Up to 70% of infections cause no symptoms.[1] Another 25% of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a soar throat and up to 5% have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs.[1][2] These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In about 0.5% of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.[1] This can occur over a few hours to few days.[1][2] The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2% to 5% of children and 15% to 30% of adults die.[1] Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.[3]

Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected feces entering the mouth.[1] It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva.[1][2] Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood.[1]

The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, a number of doses are required for it to be effective.[2] The United States Center for Disease Control recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring.[4] Once infected there is no specific treatment.[2] In 2013 polio affected 416 people down from 350,000 cases in 1988.[2] In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.[2] In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus.[5]

Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.[1] The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789[1] and the virus that causes it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner.[6] Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States.[1] In the 20th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas.[7] The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk.[8] It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.[9] In 2013; however, there were reports of new cases in Syria[10] and in May 2014, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[11] The disease does not naturally occur in any other animals.[1]

gonorrhea=Also called the "clap" or "drip," gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. Gonorrhea may also be spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, so that a mother could pass on the infection to her newborn during childbirth. Both men and women can get gonorrhea. The infection is easily spread and occurs most often in people who have many sex partners.

Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a bacterium that can grow and multiply easily in mucus membranes of the body. Gonorrhea bacteria can grow in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix (opening to the womb), uterus (womb), and fallopian tubes (egg canals) in women, and in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) in women and men. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat, and anus.

Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease in the U.S. Each year, according to the CDC, there are as many as 700,000 new cases, with less than half of them reported to the CDC. There were 334,826 reported cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2012. Sexually active teenagers have one of the highest rates of reported infections.

Not all people infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, so knowing when to seek treatment can be tricky. When symptoms do occur, they are often within two to 10 days after exposure, but they can take up to 30 days to develop and include the following:

Gonorrhea symptoms in women

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the vagina
    Lower abdominal or pelvic pain
    Burning when urinating
    Conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)
    Bleeding between periods
    Spotting after intercourse
    Swelling of the vulva (vulvitis)
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In some women, symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed.

Many women with gonorrhea discharge think they have a yeast infection and self-treat with over-the-counter yeast infection drug. Because vaginal discharge can be a sign of a number of different problems, it is best to always seek the advice of a doctor to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

Gonorrhea symptoms in men

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the penis
    Burning when urinating
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Painful or swollen testicles
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In men, symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after infection.

(See http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/gonorrhea for more info.)

diarrhea=Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, an increase in the looseness of stool or both.
    Diarrhea is caused by increased secretion of fluid into the intestine, reduced absorption of fluid from the intestine or rapid passage of stool through the intestine.
    Symptoms associated with diarrhea include abdominal pain, especially cramping. Other symptoms depend on the cause of the diarrhea.
    Diarrhea can be defined absolutely or relatively. Absolute diarrhea is defined as more than five bowel movements a day or liquid stools. Relative diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of bowel movements per day or an increase in the looseness of stools compared with an individual's usual bowel habit.
    Diarrhea may be either acute or chronic, and each has different causes and treatments.
    Complications of diarrhea include dehydration, electrolyte (mineral) abnormalities, and irritation of the anus.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of acute diarrhea include examination of stool for white blood cells or enzymes that they produce, parasites, cultures of stool for bacteria, testing of stool for the toxins of C. difficile, and blood tests for electrolyte abnormalities.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea include examination of stool for parasites, upper gastrointestinal X-rays (UGI series), barium enema, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, colonoscopy with biopsies, small intestinal endoscopy, hydrogen breath testing, measurement of fat in the stool, and pancreatic function tests.
    Dehydration can be treated at home with home remedies, oral rehydration solutions.
    Absorbents (that absorb water in the intestine), anti-motility medications, bismuth compounds, and IV fluids if necessary.
    Antibiotics should not be used in treating diarrhea unless there is a culture-proven bacterial infection that requires antibiotics, severe diarrhea that is likely to be infectious in origin, or when an individual has serious underlying diseases.


Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.

Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:

    Incontinence of stool, which is the inability to control (delay) bowel movements until an appropriate time, for example, until one can get to the toilet
    Rectal urgency, which is a sudden urge to have a bowel movement that is so strong that if a toilet is not immediately available there will be incontinence
    Incomplete evacuation, which is a sensation that another bowel movement is necessary soon after a bowel movement, yet there is difficulty passing further stool the second time
    Bowel movements immediately after eating a meal Continue Reading

epilepsy=Epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects the nervous system. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition.

Seizures seen in epilepsy are caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the brain. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown. 

Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well.

Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome.

The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. 

Having seizures and epilepsy also can also affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. How epilepsy is perceived or how people are treated (stigma) often is a bigger problem than the seizures.
  
The human brain is the source of all human epilepsy.

A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but often the cause is completely unknown. The word "epilepsy" does not indicate anything about the cause of the person's seizures or their severity.

What Happens During a Seizure?

    The electrical activity is caused by complex chemical changes that occur in nerve cells.
    Brain cells either excite or inhibit (stop) other brain cells from sending messages. Usually there is a balance of cells that excite and those that can stop these messages. However, when a seizure occurs, there may be too much or too little activity, causing an imbalance between exciting and stopping activity. The chemical changes can lead to surges of electrical activity that cause seizures.
    Seizures are not a disease in themselves. Instead, they are a symptom of many different disorders that can affect the brain. Some seizures can hardly be noticed, while others are totally disabling.

The nature of seizures varies, because the lobes of the brain control different behaviors, movements and experiences.

If I have just one or two seizures does that mean I will get epilepsy?

    About half of the people who have one seizure without a clear cause will have another one, usually within 6 months.
    If there is a known cause for your seizure (for example, brain injury or other type of known brain condition), then you are twice as likely to have another seizure.
    If you have two seizures, there's about an 80% chance that you'll have more.
    If your first seizure occurred at the time of an injury or infection in the brain, then you are more likely to develop epilepsy. Often, more seizures don\u2019t occur until weeks or months after the initial injury or infection.
    More seizures are also likely if your doctor finds abnormalities on a neurological examination (tests that are done in a doctor\u2019s office to see how the nervous system is working).
    An EEG test or electroencephalogram (e-LEK-tro_en_SEF-uh_LOG-ram) can look at the electrical activity of the brain and may help predict whether more seizures will occur. Certain patterns on the EEG are typical of epilepsy. If your brain waves show patterns of that type, you are about twice as likely to develop epilepsy.

diabetes=Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia). 

 There are three types of diabetes:
1) Type 1 diabetes
MNT Knowledge Center

The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.

Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 1 diabetes page.
2) Type 2 diabetes

The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).

Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.
Diabetes patient measuring glucose level in bloodMeasuring the glucose level in blood

Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.

Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.

Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. 

For more information on how type 1 and type 2 diabetes compare, see our article: the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 2 diabetes page.
3) Gestational diabetes

This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.

The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.

cancer=Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body\u2019s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.

Many cancers form solid tumors, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not form solid tumors.

Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.

Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. When removed, they usually don\u2019t grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life threatening.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. One important difference is that cancer cells are less specialized than normal cells. That is, whereas normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not. This is one reason that, unlike normal cells, cancer cells continue to divide without stopping.

In addition, cancer cells are able to ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or that begin a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells.

Cancer cells may be able to influence the normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels that surround and feed a tumor\u2014an area known as the microenvironment. For instance, cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, which they need to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste products from tumors.

Cancer cells are also often able to evade the immune system, a network of organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions. Although the immune system normally removes damaged or abnormal cells from the body, some cancer cells are able to \u201chide\u201d from the immune system.

Tumors can also use the immune system to stay alive and grow. For example, with the help of certain immune system cells that normally prevent a runaway immune response, cancer cells can actually keep the immune system from killing cancer cells.

Cancer is a genetic disease\u2014that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited from our parents. They can also arise during a person\u2019s lifetime as a result of errors that occur as cells divide or because of damage to DNA caused by certain environmental exposures. Cancer-causing environmental exposures include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, and radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Risk Factors page has more information.)

Each person\u2019s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.

In general, cancer cells have more genetic changes, such as mutations in DNA, than normal cells. Some of these changes may have nothing to do with the cancer; they may be the result of the cancer, rather than its cause.

HIV=HIV is a virus that gradually attacks the immune system, which is our body's natural defence against illness. If a person becomes infected with HIV, they will find it harder to fight off infections and diseases. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a T-helper cell and makes copies of itself inside them. T-helper cells are also referred to as CD4 cells.

There are many different strains of HIV \u2013 someone who is infected may carry various different strains in their body. These are classified into types, with lots of groups and subtypes. The two main types are:

    HIV-1: the most common type found worldwide
    HIV-2: this is found mainly in Western Africa, with some cases in India and Europe.
    
(See http://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids for more info.)


Multiple Sclerosis=Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).

In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged.

Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms.

There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.

(See http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 for more info.)
 
 
malaria=Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2013 an estimated 198 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 500,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 1,500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. 

(See http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/ for more info.)


fibromyalgia=Fibromyalgia syndrome affects the muscles and soft tissue. Symptoms include chronic muscle pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and painful tender points or trigger points, which can be relieved through medications, lifestyle changes and stress management. 

Symptoms of fibromyalgia come in many shapes and sizes -- and fibromyalgia is often confused with other conditions. Learn all about fibromyalgia symptoms and how to manage your symptoms effectively.

(See http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/ for more info.)


angina=If you have a feeling of pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign from your heart.

There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.

The chest pain you feel with angina happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's caused when something blocks the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.

Angina usually goes away quickly, but it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have angina. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack in the future.

There are different types of angina:

Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it's a sign that you're more likely to have one in the future. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.

Unstable angina. It happens while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long lasting, and can come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.

Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night during sleep or while at rest. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.

Angina is usually caused by heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces the heart to work with less oxygen, and that causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.

Other less common causes of chest pain include:

    A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
    An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    Narrowing of the valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)
    Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)
    Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)

Symptoms

Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:

    Aching
    Burning
    Discomfort
    Feeling of fullness in the chest
    Heaviness
    Pressure
    Squeezing

You are likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.

It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.

Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.

One study found women were more likely to use the words "pressing" or "crushing" to describe the feeling.

Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not -- and could get worse.

(See http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/guide/heart-disease-angina for more info.)


pericarditis=Pericardial disease, or pericarditis, is inflammation of any of the layers of the pericardium. The pericardium is a thin tissue sac that surrounds the heart and consists of:

    Visceral pericardium -- an inner layer that envelopes the entire heart
    A middle fluid layer to prevent friction between the visceral pericardium and parietal pericardium
    Parietal pericardium -- an outer layer made of fibrous tissue
    
Causes of pericarditis include:

    Infections
    Heart surgery
    Heart attack
    Trauma
    Tumors
    Cancer
    Radiation
    Autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma)

For some people, no cause can be found.

Pericarditis can be acute (occurring suddenly) or chronic (long-standing).
What Are the Symptoms of Pericarditis?

When present, symptoms of pericarditis may include:

    Chest pain. This pain is frequently sharp and located in the center of the chest. The pain may radiate to the neck and shoulders, and occasionally, the arms and back. It can be made worse when lying down, coughing, or swallowing and may be relieved by sitting forward.
    Low-grade fever.
    Increased heart rate.

How Is Pericarditis Diagnosed?

Your doctor can diagnose pericarditis based on:

    Reported symptoms

    Physical exam

Other tests may be performed to determine the cause of pericarditis.
What Is the Treatment for Pericarditis?

Treatment of pericarditis is based on the cause and may include:

    Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to decrease the pain and inflammation
    Steroids, used occasionally for severe attacks
    Antibiotics, if the pericarditis is due to infection
    Colchicine, particularly if symptoms last for several weeks or occur on a repetitive basis

Most patients recover from pericarditis in two to four weeks.

anemia=Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:

    Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.
    Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.
    Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.

There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.

ringworm=Ringworm is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches of ringworm on your skin at once.
Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    Beard -- tinea barbae
    Body -- tinea corporis
    Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot)
    Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch)
    Scalp -- tinea capitis

Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails.
Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm include:

    Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.
    The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges.
    Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.

If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.
Exams and Tests

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose ringworm by looking at your skin. The fungus may glow when your skin is examined with a blue light (called a Wood's lamp) in a dark room.

Tests to confirm the diagnosis may include:

    KOH exam
    Skin biopsy
    Skin culture

Treatment

To care for ringworm:

    Keep your skin clean and dry.
    Apply over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders, lotions, or creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, or similar ingredients.
    Do not wear clothing that rubs against and irritates the area.
    Wash sheets and nightclothes every day while you are infected.

Your health care provider may prescribe pills to treat the fungus if you have:

    A severe case of ringworm
    Ringworm that keeps coming back or that lasts for a long time
    Ringworm in your hair

You may need medicines such as ketoconazole, which are stronger than over-the-counter products. You may also need antibiotics to treat skin infections from strep or staph that are caused by scratching the area.

Infected pets also should be treated.

polio=Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Up to 70% of infections cause no symptoms.[1] Another 25% of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a soar throat and up to 5% have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs.[1][2] These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In about 0.5% of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.[1] This can occur over a few hours to few days.[1][2] The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2% to 5% of children and 15% to 30% of adults die.[1] Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.[3]

Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected feces entering the mouth.[1] It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva.[1][2] Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood.[1]

The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, a number of doses are required for it to be effective.[2] The United States Center for Disease Control recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring.[4] Once infected there is no specific treatment.[2] In 2013 polio affected 416 people down from 350,000 cases in 1988.[2] In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.[2] In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus.[5]

Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.[1] The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789[1] and the virus that causes it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner.[6] Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States.[1] In the 20th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas.[7] The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk.[8] It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.[9] In 2013; however, there were reports of new cases in Syria[10] and in May 2014, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[11] The disease does not naturally occur in any other animals.[1]

gonorrhea=Also called the "clap" or "drip," gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. Gonorrhea may also be spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, so that a mother could pass on the infection to her newborn during childbirth. Both men and women can get gonorrhea. The infection is easily spread and occurs most often in people who have many sex partners.

Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a bacterium that can grow and multiply easily in mucus membranes of the body. Gonorrhea bacteria can grow in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix (opening to the womb), uterus (womb), and fallopian tubes (egg canals) in women, and in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) in women and men. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat, and anus.

Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease in the U.S. Each year, according to the CDC, there are as many as 700,000 new cases, with less than half of them reported to the CDC. There were 334,826 reported cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2012. Sexually active teenagers have one of the highest rates of reported infections.

Not all people infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, so knowing when to seek treatment can be tricky. When symptoms do occur, they are often within two to 10 days after exposure, but they can take up to 30 days to develop and include the following:

Gonorrhea symptoms in women

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the vagina
    Lower abdominal or pelvic pain
    Burning when urinating
    Conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)
    Bleeding between periods
    Spotting after intercourse
    Swelling of the vulva (vulvitis)
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In some women, symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed.

Many women with gonorrhea discharge think they have a yeast infection and self-treat with over-the-counter yeast infection drug. Because vaginal discharge can be a sign of a number of different problems, it is best to always seek the advice of a doctor to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

Gonorrhea symptoms in men

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the penis
    Burning when urinating
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Painful or swollen testicles
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In men, symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after infection.

(See http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/gonorrhea for more info.)

diarrhea=Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, an increase in the looseness of stool or both.
    Diarrhea is caused by increased secretion of fluid into the intestine, reduced absorption of fluid from the intestine or rapid passage of stool through the intestine.
    Symptoms associated with diarrhea include abdominal pain, especially cramping. Other symptoms depend on the cause of the diarrhea.
    Diarrhea can be defined absolutely or relatively. Absolute diarrhea is defined as more than five bowel movements a day or liquid stools. Relative diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of bowel movements per day or an increase in the looseness of stools compared with an individual's usual bowel habit.
    Diarrhea may be either acute or chronic, and each has different causes and treatments.
    Complications of diarrhea include dehydration, electrolyte (mineral) abnormalities, and irritation of the anus.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of acute diarrhea include examination of stool for white blood cells or enzymes that they produce, parasites, cultures of stool for bacteria, testing of stool for the toxins of C. difficile, and blood tests for electrolyte abnormalities.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea include examination of stool for parasites, upper gastrointestinal X-rays (UGI series), barium enema, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, colonoscopy with biopsies, small intestinal endoscopy, hydrogen breath testing, measurement of fat in the stool, and pancreatic function tests.
    Dehydration can be treated at home with home remedies, oral rehydration solutions.
    Absorbents (that absorb water in the intestine), anti-motility medications, bismuth compounds, and IV fluids if necessary.
    Antibiotics should not be used in treating diarrhea unless there is a culture-proven bacterial infection that requires antibiotics, severe diarrhea that is likely to be infectious in origin, or when an individual has serious underlying diseases.


Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.

Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:

    Incontinence of stool, which is the inability to control (delay) bowel movements until an appropriate time, for example, until one can get to the toilet
    Rectal urgency, which is a sudden urge to have a bowel movement that is so strong that if a toilet is not immediately available there will be incontinence
    Incomplete evacuation, which is a sensation that another bowel movement is necessary soon after a bowel movement, yet there is difficulty passing further stool the second time
    Bowel movements immediately after eating a meal Continue Reading

epilepsy=Epilepsy is a neurological condition which affects the nervous system. Epilepsy is also known as a seizure disorder. It is usually diagnosed after a person has had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known medical condition.

Seizures seen in epilepsy are caused by disturbances in the electrical activity of the brain. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but most of the time the cause is unknown. 

Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Many people with epilepsy have more than one type of seizure and may have other symptoms of neurological problems as well.

Sometimes EEG testing, clinical history, family history and outlook are similar among a group of people with epilepsy. In these situations, their condition can be defined as a specific epilepsy syndrome.

The human brain is the source of human epilepsy. Although the symptoms of a seizure may affect any part of the body, the electrical events that produce the symptoms occur in the brain. The location of that event, how it spreads and how much of the brain is affected, and how long it lasts all have profound effects. These factors determine the character of a seizure and its impact on the individual. 

Having seizures and epilepsy also can also affect one's safety, relationships, work, driving and so much more. How epilepsy is perceived or how people are treated (stigma) often is a bigger problem than the seizures.
  
The human brain is the source of all human epilepsy.

A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have had at least two seizures that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. The seizures in epilepsy may be related to a brain injury or a family tendency, but often the cause is completely unknown. The word "epilepsy" does not indicate anything about the cause of the person's seizures or their severity.

What Happens During a Seizure?

    The electrical activity is caused by complex chemical changes that occur in nerve cells.
    Brain cells either excite or inhibit (stop) other brain cells from sending messages. Usually there is a balance of cells that excite and those that can stop these messages. However, when a seizure occurs, there may be too much or too little activity, causing an imbalance between exciting and stopping activity. The chemical changes can lead to surges of electrical activity that cause seizures.
    Seizures are not a disease in themselves. Instead, they are a symptom of many different disorders that can affect the brain. Some seizures can hardly be noticed, while others are totally disabling.

The nature of seizures varies, because the lobes of the brain control different behaviors, movements and experiences.

If I have just one or two seizures does that mean I will get epilepsy?

    About half of the people who have one seizure without a clear cause will have another one, usually within 6 months.
    If there is a known cause for your seizure (for example, brain injury or other type of known brain condition), then you are twice as likely to have another seizure.
    If you have two seizures, there's about an 80% chance that you'll have more.
    If your first seizure occurred at the time of an injury or infection in the brain, then you are more likely to develop epilepsy. Often, more seizures don\u2019t occur until weeks or months after the initial injury or infection.
    More seizures are also likely if your doctor finds abnormalities on a neurological examination (tests that are done in a doctor\u2019s office to see how the nervous system is working).
    An EEG test or electroencephalogram (e-LEK-tro_en_SEF-uh_LOG-ram) can look at the electrical activity of the brain and may help predict whether more seizures will occur. Certain patterns on the EEG are typical of epilepsy. If your brain waves show patterns of that type, you are about twice as likely to develop epilepsy.

diabetes=Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as diabetes mellitus, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both. Patients with high blood sugar will typically experience polyuria (frequent urination), they will become increasingly thirsty (polydipsia) and hungry (polyphagia). 

 There are three types of diabetes:
1) Type 1 diabetes
MNT Knowledge Center

The body does not produce insulin. Some people may refer to this type as insulin-dependent diabetes, juvenile diabetes, or early-onset diabetes. People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years.

Type 1 diabetes is nowhere near as common as type 2 diabetes. Approximately 10% of all diabetes cases are type 1.

Patients with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.

Between 2001 and 2009, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes among the under 20s in the USA rose 23%, according to SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth data issued by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). 

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 1 diabetes page.
2) Type 2 diabetes

The body does not produce enough insulin for proper function, or the cells in the body do not react to insulin (insulin resistance).

Approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.
Diabetes patient measuring glucose level in bloodMeasuring the glucose level in blood

Some people may be able to control their type 2 diabetes symptoms by losing weight, following a healthy diet, doing plenty of exercise, and monitoring their blood glucose levels. However, type 2 diabetes is typically a progressive disease - it gradually gets worse - and the patient will probably end up have to take insulin, usually in tablet form.

Overweight and obese people have a much higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with a healthy body weight. People with a lot of visceral fat, also known as central obesity, belly fat, or abdominal obesity, are especially at risk. Being overweight/obese causes the body to release chemicals that can destabilize the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.

Being overweight, physically inactive and eating the wrong foods all contribute to our risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Drinking just one can of (non-diet) soda per day can raise our risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 22%, researchers from Imperial College London reported in the journal Diabetologia. The scientists believe that the impact of sugary soft drinks on diabetes risk may be a direct one, rather than simply an influence on body weight.

The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. Experts are not completely sure why, but say that as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. Those with a close relative who had/had type 2 diabetes, people of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a higher risk of developing the disease.

Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, say that low testosterone levels are linked to insulin resistance. 

For more information on how type 1 and type 2 diabetes compare, see our article: the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

More information on type 1 diabetes is available in our type 2 diabetes page.
3) Gestational diabetes

This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made during pregnancy.

The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. Between 10% to 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be.

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol had a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to their counterparts whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.

cancer=Cancer is the name given to a collection of related diseases. In all types of cancer, some of the body\u2019s cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues.

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

When cancer develops, however, this orderly process breaks down. As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed. These extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors.

Many cancers form solid tumors, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not form solid tumors.

Cancerous tumors are malignant, which means they can spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. In addition, as these tumors grow, some cancer cells can break off and travel to distant places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumors far from the original tumor.

Unlike malignant tumors, benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. When removed, they usually don\u2019t grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life threatening.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways that allow them to grow out of control and become invasive. One important difference is that cancer cells are less specialized than normal cells. That is, whereas normal cells mature into very distinct cell types with specific functions, cancer cells do not. This is one reason that, unlike normal cells, cancer cells continue to divide without stopping.

In addition, cancer cells are able to ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or that begin a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which the body uses to get rid of unneeded cells.

Cancer cells may be able to influence the normal cells, molecules, and blood vessels that surround and feed a tumor\u2014an area known as the microenvironment. For instance, cancer cells can induce nearby normal cells to form blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, which they need to grow. These blood vessels also remove waste products from tumors.

Cancer cells are also often able to evade the immune system, a network of organs, tissues, and specialized cells that protects the body from infections and other conditions. Although the immune system normally removes damaged or abnormal cells from the body, some cancer cells are able to \u201chide\u201d from the immune system.

Tumors can also use the immune system to stay alive and grow. For example, with the help of certain immune system cells that normally prevent a runaway immune response, cancer cells can actually keep the immune system from killing cancer cells.

Cancer is a genetic disease\u2014that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genetic changes that cause cancer can be inherited from our parents. They can also arise during a person\u2019s lifetime as a result of errors that occur as cells divide or because of damage to DNA caused by certain environmental exposures. Cancer-causing environmental exposures include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, and radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Risk Factors page has more information.)

Each person\u2019s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.

In general, cancer cells have more genetic changes, such as mutations in DNA, than normal cells. Some of these changes may have nothing to do with the cancer; they may be the result of the cancer, rather than its cause.

HIV=HIV is a virus that gradually attacks the immune system, which is our body's natural defence against illness. If a person becomes infected with HIV, they will find it harder to fight off infections and diseases. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a T-helper cell and makes copies of itself inside them. T-helper cells are also referred to as CD4 cells.

There are many different strains of HIV \u2013 someone who is infected may carry various different strains in their body. These are classified into types, with lots of groups and subtypes. The two main types are:

    HIV-1: the most common type found worldwide
    HIV-2: this is found mainly in Western Africa, with some cases in India and Europe.
    
(See http://www.avert.org/about-hiv-aids/what-hiv-aids for more info.)


Multiple Sclerosis=Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).

In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged.

Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms.

There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms.

(See http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 for more info.)
 
 
malaria=Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. People with malaria often experience fever, chills, and flu-like illness. Left untreated, they may develop severe complications and die. In 2013 an estimated 198 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 500,000 people died, mostly children in the African Region. About 1,500 cases of malaria are diagnosed in the United States each year. The vast majority of cases in the United States are in travelers and immigrants returning from countries where malaria transmission occurs, many from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

angina=If you have a feeling of pressure or a squeezing in your chest, it may be angina. It can feel like a heart attack, but often it's a warning sign from your heart.

There's a lot you can do to stop it from happening. Usually, medicine along with lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.

The chest pain you feel with angina happens because there isn't enough blood flowing to part of your heart. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it's caused when something blocks the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.

Angina usually goes away quickly, but it can be a symptom of a life-threatening heart problem. Call your doctor if you have angina. It's important to find out what's going on and to talk about what you can do to avoid a heart attack in the future.

There are different types of angina:

Stable angina is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it's a sign that you're more likely to have one in the future. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.

Unstable angina. It happens while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long lasting, and can come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.

Prinzmetal's angina (also called variant angina) is rare. It might happen at night during sleep or while at rest. The heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.

Angina is usually caused by heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart muscle. This forces the heart to work with less oxygen, and that causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.

Other less common causes of chest pain include:

    A blockage in a major artery of the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
    An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    Narrowing of the valve in the main part of the heart (aortic stenosis)
    Swelling of the sac around the heart (pericarditis)
    Tearing in the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)

Symptoms

Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may feel:

    Aching
    Burning
    Discomfort
    Feeling of fullness in the chest
    Heaviness
    Pressure
    Squeezing

You are likely to have pain behind your breastbone, but it can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.

It's possible to mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.

Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.

One study found women were more likely to use the words "pressing" or "crushing" to describe the feeling.

Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not -- and could get worse.

pericarditis=Pericardial disease, or pericarditis, is inflammation of any of the layers of the pericardium. The pericardium is a thin tissue sac that surrounds the heart and consists of:

    Visceral pericardium -- an inner layer that envelopes the entire heart
    A middle fluid layer to prevent friction between the visceral pericardium and parietal pericardium
    Parietal pericardium -- an outer layer made of fibrous tissue
    
Causes of pericarditis include:

    Infections
    Heart surgery
    Heart attack
    Trauma
    Tumors
    Cancer
    Radiation
    Autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma)

For some people, no cause can be found.

Pericarditis can be acute (occurring suddenly) or chronic (long-standing).
What Are the Symptoms of Pericarditis?

When present, symptoms of pericarditis may include:

    Chest pain. This pain is frequently sharp and located in the center of the chest. The pain may radiate to the neck and shoulders, and occasionally, the arms and back. It can be made worse when lying down, coughing, or swallowing and may be relieved by sitting forward.
    Low-grade fever.
    Increased heart rate.

How Is Pericarditis Diagnosed?

Your doctor can diagnose pericarditis based on:

    Reported symptoms
    Electrocardiagram (EKG or ECG) results
    Physical exam

Other tests may be performed to determine the cause of pericarditis.
What Is the Treatment for Pericarditis?

Treatment of pericarditis is based on the cause and may include:

    Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to decrease the pain and inflammation
    Steroids, used occasionally for severe attacks
    Antibiotics, if the pericarditis is due to infection
    Colchicine, particularly if symptoms last for several weeks or occur on a repetitive basis

Most patients recover from pericarditis in two to four weeks.

anemia=Anemia is a condition that develops when your blood lacks enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a main part of red blood cells and binds oxygen. If you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or your hemoglobin is abnormal or low, the cells in your body will not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue -- occur because organs aren't getting what they need to function properly.

Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects about 3.5 million Americans. Women, young children, and people with chronic diseases are at increased risk of anemia. Important factors to remember are:

    Certain forms of anemia are hereditary and infants may be affected from the time of birth.
    Women in the childbearing years are particularly susceptible to iron-deficiency anemia because of the blood loss from menstruation and the increased blood supply demands during pregnancy.
    Older adults also may have a greater risk of developing anemia because of poor diet and other medical conditions.

There are many types of anemia. All are very different in their causes and treatments. Iron-deficiency anemia, the most common type, is very treatable with diet changes and iron supplements. Some forms of anemia -- like the anemia that develops during pregnancy -- are even considered normal. However, some types of anemia may present lifelong health problems.

ringworm=Ringworm is a skin infection due to a fungus. Often, there are several patches of ringworm on your skin at once.
Causes

Ringworm is common, especially among children. However, it may affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.

Many bacteria and fungi live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus called tinea grows and multiplies on your skin.

Ringworm can affect the skin on your:

    Beard -- tinea barbae
    Body -- tinea corporis
    Feet -- tinea pedis (also called athlete's foot)
    Groin area -- tinea cruris (also called jock itch)
    Scalp -- tinea capitis

Ringworm can spread easily from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come into contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets that carry the fungus. Cats are common carriers.

The fungus that causes ringworm thrive in warm, moist areas. Ringworm is more likely when you are often wet (such as from sweating) and from minor injuries to your skin, scalp, or nails.
Symptoms

Symptoms of ringworm include:

    Itchy, red, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze.
    The patches tend to have sharply-defined edges.
    Red patches are often redder around the outside with normal skin tone in the center. This may look like a ring.

If ringworm affects your hair, you will have bald patches.

If ringworm affects your nails, they will become discolored, thick, and even crumble.
Exams and Tests

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose ringworm by looking at your skin. The fungus may glow when your skin is examined with a blue light (called a Wood's lamp) in a dark room.

Tests to confirm the diagnosis may include:

    KOH exam
    Skin biopsy
    Skin culture

Treatment

To care for ringworm:

    Keep your skin clean and dry.
    Apply over-the-counter antifungal or drying powders, lotions, or creams that contain miconazole, clotrimazole, or similar ingredients.
    Do not wear clothing that rubs against and irritates the area.
    Wash sheets and nightclothes every day while you are infected.

Your health care provider may prescribe pills to treat the fungus if you have:

    A severe case of ringworm
    Ringworm that keeps coming back or that lasts for a long time
    Ringworm in your hair

You may need medicines such as ketoconazole, which are stronger than over-the-counter products. You may also need antibiotics to treat skin infections from strep or staph that are caused by scratching the area.

Infected pets also should be treated.

polio=Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Up to 70% of infections cause no symptoms.[1] Another 25% of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a soar throat and up to 5% have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs.[1][2] These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In about 0.5% of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move.[1] This can occur over a few hours to few days.[1][2] The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2% to 5% of children and 15% to 30% of adults die.[1] Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.[3]

Poliovirus is usually spread from person to person through infected feces entering the mouth.[1] It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva.[1][2] Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood.[1]

The disease is preventable with the polio vaccine; however, a number of doses are required for it to be effective.[2] The United States Center for Disease Control recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring.[4] Once infected there is no specific treatment.[2] In 2013 polio affected 416 people down from 350,000 cases in 1988.[2] In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.[2] In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus.[5]

Poliomyelitis has existed for thousands of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art.[1] The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789[1] and the virus that causes it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner.[6] Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States.[1] In the 20th century it became one of the most worrying childhood diseases in these areas.[7] The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk.[8] It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.[9] In 2013; however, there were reports of new cases in Syria[10] and in May 2014, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency of international concern due to outbreaks of the disease in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[11] The disease does not naturally occur in any other animals.[1]

gonorrhea=Also called the "clap" or "drip," gonorrhea is a contagious disease transmitted most often through sexual contact with an infected person. Gonorrhea may also be spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, so that a mother could pass on the infection to her newborn during childbirth. Both men and women can get gonorrhea. The infection is easily spread and occurs most often in people who have many sex partners.

Gonorrhea is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a bacterium that can grow and multiply easily in mucus membranes of the body. Gonorrhea bacteria can grow in the warm, moist areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix (opening to the womb), uterus (womb), and fallopian tubes (egg canals) in women, and in the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) in women and men. The bacteria can also grow in the mouth, throat, and anus.

Gonorrhea is a very common infectious disease in the U.S. Each year, according to the CDC, there are as many as 700,000 new cases, with less than half of them reported to the CDC. There were 334,826 reported cases of gonorrhea in the U.S. in 2012. Sexually active teenagers have one of the highest rates of reported infections.

Not all people infected with gonorrhea have symptoms, so knowing when to seek treatment can be tricky. When symptoms do occur, they are often within two to 10 days after exposure, but they can take up to 30 days to develop and include the following:

Gonorrhea symptoms in women

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the vagina
    Lower abdominal or pelvic pain
    Burning when urinating
    Conjunctivitis (red, itchy eyes)
    Bleeding between periods
    Spotting after intercourse
    Swelling of the vulva (vulvitis)
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In some women, symptoms are so mild that they go unnoticed.

Many women with gonorrhea discharge think they have a yeast infection and self-treat with over-the-counter yeast infection drug. Because vaginal discharge can be a sign of a number of different problems, it is best to always seek the advice of a doctor to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment.

Gonorrhea symptoms in men

    Greenish yellow or whitish discharge from the penis
    Burning when urinating
    Burning in the throat (due to oral sex)
    Painful or swollen testicles
    Swollen glands in the throat (due to oral sex)

In men, symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after infection.

(See http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/gonorrhea for more info.)

diarrhea=Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, an increase in the looseness of stool or both.
    Diarrhea is caused by increased secretion of fluid into the intestine, reduced absorption of fluid from the intestine or rapid passage of stool through the intestine.
    Symptoms associated with diarrhea include abdominal pain, especially cramping. Other symptoms depend on the cause of the diarrhea.
    Diarrhea can be defined absolutely or relatively. Absolute diarrhea is defined as more than five bowel movements a day or liquid stools. Relative diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of bowel movements per day or an increase in the looseness of stools compared with an individual's usual bowel habit.
    Diarrhea may be either acute or chronic, and each has different causes and treatments.
    Complications of diarrhea include dehydration, electrolyte (mineral) abnormalities, and irritation of the anus.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of acute diarrhea include examination of stool for white blood cells or enzymes that they produce, parasites, cultures of stool for bacteria, testing of stool for the toxins of C. difficile, and blood tests for electrolyte abnormalities.
    Tests that are useful in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea include examination of stool for parasites, upper gastrointestinal X-rays (UGI series), barium enema, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, colonoscopy with biopsies, small intestinal endoscopy, hydrogen breath testing, measurement of fat in the stool, and pancreatic function tests.
    Dehydration can be treated at home with home remedies, oral rehydration solutions.
    Absorbents (that absorb water in the intestine), anti-motility medications, bismuth compounds, and IV fluids if necessary.
    Antibiotics should not be used in treating diarrhea unless there is a culture-proven bacterial infection that requires antibiotics, severe diarrhea that is likely to be infectious in origin, or when an individual has serious underlying diseases.


Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.

Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:

    Incontinence of stool, which is the inability to control (delay) bowel movements until an appropriate time, for example, until one can get to the toilet
    Rectal urgency, which is a sudden urge to have a bowel movement that is so strong that if a toilet is not immediately available there will be incontinence
    Incomplete evacuation, which is a sensation that another bowel movement is necessary soon after a bowel movement, yet there is difficulty passing further stool the second time
    Bowel movements immediately after eating a meal Continue Reading
